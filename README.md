### Local Testing
Running `trunk serve` will build the project and host a local server that automatically rebuilds, allowing changes to be seen in realtime. 

To build the project without hosting simply run `cargo build` as normal

---
### Production
Running `trunk build --release` will generate files in a `dist` directory that can be served as static html.

This repo is setup with Github Actions to automatically build any push to the main branch and hosts the dist directory on Github Pages
